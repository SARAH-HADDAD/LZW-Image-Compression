# LZW Encoding and Decoding for Image
The LZW image compression algorithm is a lossless compression algorithm that can be used to compress images. It works by creating a dictionary of all the possible substrings of the image data. Each substring is assigned a unique code. When the algorithm compresses the image data, it replaces each substring with its corresponding code. This reduces the size of the image data by removing duplicate information.
LZW algorithm is often used with GIF or images with not a lot of color.
